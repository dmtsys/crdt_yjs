onConnect:

we have hardcoded yDoc name:

setupServerConnection(channel, { docName: 'count-demo' });

before it was part of the url when connecting websocket...

perhaps use "sublane" or something like this... 
sublane would be mapped to integers... and then each binary message could have three-digit padded index number of sublane so that
multiple documents can get synced over the same wire
